Hi everyone, my name is Sahil, and I am undergraduate student at UMass Lowell
pursing computer science. This will be my final semester!

I chose to take this course because I have a strong interest in low-level
software development but have always had some difficultly figuring out how to
start. I hope to learn a lot through KDLP.

In my free time, I enjoy fiddling around with my guitar, coding, and playing
video games on my Switch and PC.
