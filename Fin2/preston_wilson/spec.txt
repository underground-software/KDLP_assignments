Kernel Hangman

This driver implements a character device for playing the game of hangman. The
goal of the game is to determine the mystery word by guessing a letter each
turn. The user will be able to guess the word as well but will be penalized if
it is wrong indicated by a lost limb.

On load, a new random word is generated from a preset list of possible words
and the hangman is reset to have all of their limbs.

The device will show up in the '/dev' directory as '/dev/hangman'. The game
state is shared between all open file descriptors as well.

The device supports the following operations:
Read
    -Read the current state of hangman and how many letters correctly guessed
    -Letters not guessed are hidden by a '_' character
    -Display current game space as ascii art
        e.g. is at bottom of spec
    -Return number of turns left
        "You have _ tries left..."
    -Win or lose status when number of tries = 0 or word is correctly solved
        e.g. "YOU SAVED THE STICKMAN! GOOD JOB!!!"
Write
    -Used to guess a letter or even a word
    -User types in a single letter and is compared with the word in play
    -One character is expected so anything greater than one will simply be
        ignored
    -The list of accepted letters include
        [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z]
        anything else will be an invalid guess so the player will be
        prompted to guess again without a penalty
        -A negative error number is returned if invalid
Seek
    -Manipulates the file position between subsequent reads
Ioctl
    -'IOC_HANGMAN_RESET' _IO(0x11,0)
        -Command to reset game state and generate new word
        -Expects no arguements
        -Return 0 on success, -1 on failure
    -'IOC_HANGMAN_GUESS' _IO(0x11,1)
        -Command that allows the user to guess the word
        -Expects a character array symbolizing the user's guess for the word
Open
    -Opens a file descriptor
Close
    -Closes a file descriptor
