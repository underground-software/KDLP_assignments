It's a mardown so might as well use it lmao

My name is Vladimir Ventura, and I'm a Senior CS major with a Math minor in UML.

I'm into building frontend stuff with React.js, and backend stuff with tools like Node/Express, Flask, FastAPI, and others. 
This should be my last semester in UML, unless Linear Algebra II has something to say about it.

In my free time, I like to play games (specially fighting games), and also play music instruments (guitar, bass, piano, and drums).
