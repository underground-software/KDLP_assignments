I'm all about creating awesome stuff, reading books, swimming like a champ (retired for now), watching anime (Sharingan forever!), and strumming my guitar.  Oh, and let's not forget my love for GNU/Linux, GNU Emacs and all things free software.  I'm also a recovering typography nerd and in my spare time, I'm working on becoming the next Saitama Sensei (One Punch man, anyone?)

When it comes to me, I like to think of myself as a Sensei in the Art of Anything (yes, I've mastered AA).  I like to dabble in a little bit of everything that's cool.  That includes electronics, coding, playing the guitar, reading books (because yes, books are cool) and swimming (50 fly like a boss).  I'm all about Emacs and I'm a Linux enthusiast.

If you ever feel the need to communicate with me, feel free to shoot me an email at me[at]bonfacemunyoki[dot]com \m/\m/
