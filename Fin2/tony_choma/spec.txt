Caesars Cipher Character Device

This character device will support the Caesars Cipher, taking a message from the user and encrypting it using a simple algorithm.

The algorithm known as the Caesars Cipher take each letter in a message and replaces it with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet (very simple form of encryption).

The character device will show up in '/dev/' as a special character device file named 'caesars_cipher'. All users can interact with the file and the state of the file is shared between all open file descriptor.

The special character device file supports the following operations: open, close, read, write, lseek, ioctl.

Operations:
	- Open:
		- The open system call is used to open a file that will be used for encryption and decryption.
		- The file should be opened in read and write mode.
		- The return value of this system call is a file descriptor, which is a non-negative integer that identifies the file in the following operations to come.

	- Read:
		- The read system call is used to read data from the file into a memory buffer.
		- The return value of this system call is the number of bytes that are read.
		- The read system call should be used to read the data to be encrypted.

	- Write:
		- The write system call is used to write data from a buffer into the memory of the file.
		- The return value of this system call is the number of bytes written.
		- The write system call should be used to write the encrypted data back to the file.

	- Close:
		- The close system call is used to close the file and release the proper resources.
		- It takes a file descriptor as input and returns zero on success.
		- All open file descriptors should be closed when they are no longer needed.

	- lseek:
		- The lseek system call is used to change the current position in the file.
		- It takes three arguments: the file descriptor, the offset, and the origin.
		- The offset is the number of bytes to move the file pointer, and the origin can be one of these values below:
			- SEEK_SET (set the position to the offset).
			- SEEK_CUR (set the position to the current position plus the offset).
			- SEEK_END (set the position to the end of the file plus the offset).
			- The return value of this system call is the new file position.

	- ioctl:
		- The ioctl system call is to be used to set the number of positions down the alphabet that each letter should be shifted in the Caesar cipher.
		- The ioctl system call takes three arguments: the file descriptor, the request code, and a pointer to an argument.
		- The request code specifies the operation to be performed, and the argument is a pointer to a buffer that contains any necessary data.
		- The return value of this system call is zero on success.
