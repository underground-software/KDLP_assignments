Hello all,

This is Sepehr Madani, some might know me by Sep. Excited to be working with you
all to learn and become a better software developer.

A fun fact about me is that my brother and I are respectively named after the
first name and the last name of a famous contemporary Iranian poet, so whenever
(Iranian) people hear our names, they excitedly exclaim that our names are just
like the poet, to which I always patiently smile and say, "Yes, that's precisely
 where it comes from!". Also, "Sepehr" in Farsi is a literary word used in
 poetry which means sky. Pronounced like Sep + Air.
