My name is Paul Nwoko. I am an Electronic Engineer. I love Embedded systems and i have been building embedded systems for various applications for my clients for over 5 years.
Requirements for Embedded systems of today are becoming advanced and most require operating systems like Linux OS to run their applications, So i see the need to familiarize myself with the Linux kernel and kernel development process to be able to handle projects/tasks that require developing custom Linux OS for embedded applications, enabling Linux on various hardware platforms like the beagle bone and raspberry pi boards, develop Linux device driver etc.
I am confident that this mentorship program will expose me to all that is needed to get started as a Linux kernel developer, deploy Linux on embedded devices and contribute to opensource projects.
