Hello everyone,

My name is Chimdi, im computer science student at stellenbosch university, despite using linux everyday and being fascinated that all of it is open source i dont still dont fully get linux or how to actually make meaningful contributions, so im taking this course to see if this is something i would really enjoy or if i would prefer to admire it from afar.

Hope i enjoy it though. and it's great to meet you all.
